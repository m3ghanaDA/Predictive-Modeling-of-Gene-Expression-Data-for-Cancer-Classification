# Cancer Type Classification Using Gene Expression Data

## 1. Problem Definition
### Objective
Develop machine learning models to classify cancer types (invasive vs. noninvasive) using gene expression data.

### Dataset
- **Source**: "Gene Expression Cancer" dataset.
- **Size**: 78 samples (patients) Ã— 4948 genes.
- **Classes**: Invasive and Noninvasive cancer.

---

## 2. Data Collection
### Data Characteristics
- **Features**: Gene expression levels for 4948 genes.
- **Labels**: Binary (invasive or noninvasive cancer).

---

## 3. Data Preprocessing
### Steps
- **Missing Values**: Imputed 77 missing values with column means.
- **Scaling**: Normalized all features for uniform scaling.
- **Duplicates and Zero-Values**: Verified none were present.

---

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Dimensionality Reduction
- **PCA**: Reduced data to 78 principal components, selecting the top 4 to capture most variance.
- **High-Variance Genes**: Applied t-tests to highlight genes differentiating cancer types.

## 5. Unsupervised Learning
### 5.1 K-means Clustering
- **Goal**: Cluster genes and patients based on expression patterns.
- **Results**:
  - Optimal clusters (genes): 6.
  - Clustering patients was ineffective due to high similarity.

### 5.2 Hierarchical Clustering
- **Goal**: Visualize gene clustering with dendrograms.
- **Results**:
  - Complete linkage with two clusters outperformed K-means.
  - Validated by silhouette scores.
